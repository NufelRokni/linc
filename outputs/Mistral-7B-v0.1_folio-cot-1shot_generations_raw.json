        "The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.\nThe problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nThe premises are given in the form of a set of first-order logic sentences.\nThe conclusion is given in the form of a single first-order logic sentence.\nThe task is to translate each of the premises and conclusions into FOL expressions, \n\n\n<PREMISES>\nAll dispensable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is dispensable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNo good things are bad.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not dispensable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if a worksheet is not dispensable. From premise 6, we know that a worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly. If it is paper, then from premise 3, a worksheet is woodware, and from premise 2, a worksheet is dispensable. If it is environment-friendly, we know it is good from premise 5, but we know nothing about whether it is dispensable. Therefore, we don't know if a worksheet is dispensible or not, so the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n<PREMISES>\nAll students are humans.\nIf someone studies, then they are a student.\nA person either studys or teaches.\nNo young person teaches.\nJerry neither teaches nor is a manager.\nRose is young or a student.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nRose is a human or Jerry is a manager.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nWe want to evaluate if Rose is a human or Jerry is a manager.\nFrom premise 3, we know that someone is a student if they study. Since we know Rose is young or a student, we can infer that she must study. This means that Rose is a student. From premise 1, we can infer that Rose is a human.\nFrom premise 5, we know that Jerry neither teaches nor is a manager. From premise 2, we know that if someone studies, they are a student. Therefore, Jerry is not a student. This means that he is not a human.\nFrom premise 4, we know that no young person teaches. Rose is young, therefore, she is not a teacher.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>"

From the second premise, we know the monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals, including humans. From the third and fourth premises, we know humans are mammals. From the fifth premise, we know people feel tired when they get a glu. We don't know whether it is possible to get a flu. We don't know whether monkeypox is a flu. We don't know whether a flu is an infectious disease. We don't know whether glu is an infectious disease. Therefore, we don't know if a glu is a flu. Therefore, we don't know if no one gets flu.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>"
