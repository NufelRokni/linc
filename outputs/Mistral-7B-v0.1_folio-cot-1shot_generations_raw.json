From premise 1, we know that it is. But from premise 2, we know that it can't occur in humans, so we can't conclude if it's infectious or not. Now let's see if monkeypox is an infectious disease. From premise 1, we know that it is. But from premise 2, we know that it can't occur in humans, so we can't conclude if it's an infectious disease or not. Now let's see if monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus. From premise 1, we know that it is. But from premise 2, we know that it can't occur in humans, so we can't conclude if it's caused by the monkeypox virus or not. Now let's see if monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals, including humans. From premise 2, we know that it can. But from premise 1, we know that it's an infectious disease, so we can't conclude if it can or not. Now let's see if humans are mammals. From premise 3, we know that they are. But from premise 2, we know that they're animals, so we can't conclude if they're mammals or not. Now let's see if mammals are animals. From premise 4, we know that they are. But from premise 3, we know that humans are mammals, so we can't conclude if they're animals or not. Now let's see if symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, feeling tired, and so on. From premise 5, we know that they do. But from premise 6, we know that people feel tired when they get a glu, so we can't conclude if symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, feeling tired, and so on or not. So, we can't conclude if monkeypox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus, or if monkeypox is an infectious disease.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>"]]
