The conclusion is a compound statement that is made up of three clauses, two of which are negations. We want to know if KO is a growth company's stock or if its price is volatile. From premise 1, we know that all growth companies' stocks are volatile, so if KO is a growth company's stock, then its price is volatile. Therefore, the first clause is true.\nThe second clause is a bit more complex. From premise 2, we know that if the stock price is volatile, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund. From premise 4, we know that all mature companies' stocks are suitable for a retirement fund. From premise 3, we know that some companies' stocks are growth companies' stocks. Therefore, we know that KO is not a mature company's stock. Since it is not a mature company's stock, we can conclude that its price is not volatile.\nThe third clause is also a bit more complex. From premise 3, we know that some companies' stocks are growth companies' stocks. From premise 4, we know that all mature companies' stocks are suitable for a retirement fund. From premise 5, we know that KO is a mature company's stock. Therefore, we know that its price is not volatile.\nNow, we have to consider the negations in the conclusion. From premise 2, we know that if the stock price is volatile, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund. From premise 4, we know that all mature companies' stocks are suitable for a retirement fund. Therefore, we know that KO is not a company's stock.\nOverall, we can conclude that if KO is a growth company's stock or if its price is volatile, then KO is neither a company's stock nor is its price volatile.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>", "The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.\nThe problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nThe premises are given in the form of a set of first-order logic sentences.\nThe conclusion is given in the form of a single first-order logic sentence.\nThe task is to translate each of the premises and conclusions into FOL expressions, \n\n\n<PREMISES>\nAll dispensable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is dispensable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNo good things are bad.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not dispensable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.

The conclusion states that if KO is a growth company\u2019s stock or if its price is volatile, then KO is neither a company\u2019s stock nor is its price volatile. So we need to prove that if KO is a growth company\u2019s stock or if its price is volatile, then KO is not a company\u2019s stock or is not volatile. From premise 2, we know that if the stock price is volatile, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund. From premise 1, we know that all growth companies\u2019 stocks are volatile. If KO is a growth company\u2019s stock, then KO is volatile, and thus, from premise 2, it is not suitable for a retirement fund, and thus, not a company\u2019s stock. Similarly, if KO\u2019s stock price is volatile, then from premise 2, KO is not a company\u2019s stock. Therefore, if KO is a growth company\u2019s stock or if its price is volatile, then KO is not a company\u2019s stock. From premise 3, some companies\u2019 stocks are growth companies\u2019 stocks. If KO is a growth company\u2019s stock, then it is a company\u2019s stock. Therefore, if KO is a growth company\u2019s stock or if its price is volatile, then KO is a company\u2019s stock. From premise 4, all mature companies\u2019 stocks are suitable for a retirement fund. If KO is a mature company\u2019s stock, then it is suitable for a retirement fund, and thus, not volatile. Therefore, if KO is a growth company\u2019s stock or if its price is volatile, then KO is not volatile. Therefore, if KO is a growth company\u2019s stock or if its price is volatile, then KO is not a company\u2019s stock or is not volatile.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n<PREMISE", "The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.\nThe problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nThe premises are given in the form of a set of first-order logic sentences.\nThe conclusion is given in the form of a single first-order logic sentence.\nThe task is to translate each of the premises and conclusions into FOL expressions, \n\n\n<PREMISES>\nAll dispensable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is dispensable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNo good things are bad.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not dispensable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.

From premise 1, we know that if the restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, then the restaurant does not receive many negative reviews. From premise 2, we know that if the restaurant has a rating greater than 9, then the restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations. From premise 3, we know that some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. From premise 4, we know that all restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than 9. From premise 5, we know that Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents. By combining these premises, we can conclude that Subway is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, and therefore it does not receive many negative reviews.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n<PREMISES>\nIf the store is in the city center, then the store has high foot traffic.\nAll stores with low profitability are in the city center.\nSome stores have high foot traffic.\nAll stores that are in the city center have high foot traffic.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nSome stores are in the city center.\n</", "The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.\nThe problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nThe premises are given in the form of a set of first-order logic sentences.\nThe conclusion is given in the form of a single first-order logic sentence.\nThe task is to translate each of the premises and conclusions into FOL expressions, \n\n\n<PREMISES>\nAll dispensable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is dispensable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNo good things are bad.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not dispensable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.

From premises 3 and 5, we know that Subway does not provide take-out service if it is popular among local residents. Therefore, from premises 4, 3, and 5, we know that Subway does not provide take-out service if it has a rating greater than 9. From premise 1, we know that if a restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, then it does not receive many negative reviews. From premise 2, we know that all restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations. From premises 4 and 2, we know that Subway is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, so it does not receive many negative reviews. From premises 6 and 7, we know that Subway is popular among local residents, and from premise 5, we know that Subway has a rating greater than 9.

If we can determine if John travels to Paris for their honeymoon, then we can determine if John has a wedding. Looking at premise 5, we know that if John has at least one child, then John does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding. Since we already know that John does not have at least one child, we can conclude that John does not travel to Paris for their honeymoon and does not have a wedding.\n\nNow we can evaluate if John has a wedding in July.

We can eliminate the first option because we know from premise 3 that all weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon. So, if John has a wedding that is well-attended, then he travels to Paris for their honeymoon. From premise 4, we know that John does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon if he has at least one child, but John does not have at least one child if he has a wedding that is well-attended.
