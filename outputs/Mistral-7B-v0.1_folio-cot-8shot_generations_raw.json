[["The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.\nThe problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nThe premises are given in the form of a set of first-order logic sentences.\nThe conclusion is given in the form of a single first-order logic sentence.\nThe task is to translate each of the premises and conclusions into FOL expressions, \n\n\n<PREMISES>\nAll dispensable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is dispensable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNo good things are bad.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not dispensable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if a worksheet is not dispensable. From premise 6, we know that a worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly. If it is paper, then from premise 3, a worksheet is woodware, and from premise 2, a worksheet is dispensable. If it is environment-friendly, we know it is good from premise 5, but we know nothing about whether it is dispensable. Therefore, we don't know if a worksheet is dispensible or not, so the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n<PREMISES>\nA La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another if it receives more points.\nIf two La Liga soccer teams recieve the same points, the team which recieves more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\nReal Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\nIn La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid recieves 86 points and Barcelon recieves 73 points.\nIn La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid and Barcelona both recieve 3 points from the games between them.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIn La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona. From premise 1, we know that a La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another if it receives more points. From premise 4, we know that in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona. Therefore, in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, so Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n<PREMISES>\nAll athletes are good at sports.\nAll Olympic gold medal winners are good athletes.\nNo scientists are good at sports.\nAll Nobel laureates are scientists.\nAmy is good at sports or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\nIf Amy is not a Nobel laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIf Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate\". Let's assume that Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner. This doesn't tell us anything about whether Amy is a Nobel laureate, so the statement isn't true, meaning it is either False or Uncertain. To distinguish between the two, notice that we could have a scenario where Amy is neither an Olympic gold medal winner nor a Nobel laureate. None of the premises are violated in this case. This means the statement must be false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n<PREMISES>\nAll people who are respected by others are people who contribute to the country.\nIf a person is respected by others, then he/she contributes to the country.\nAll people available to have a visit without any fees are those respected by others.\nAll Customers who once served in the army are available to have a visit without any fees.\nAll people who once were sentenced for thief stayed in prison for some time.\nAll people who once stayed in prison for some time have a bad record in the local state.\nJames was either once sentenced for thief or stayed in prison for some time.\nJames is either with a bad record in the local state or respected by others.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nJames contributes to the country.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if James contributes to the country. Let's think about what we know about James. First, we know that James was either sentenced for thief or stayed in prison. However, this doesn't tell us anything about whether James contributed to the country. Second, we know that James either had a bad record in the local state or that he was respected by others. However, the premises don't tell us anything about the relationship between having a bad record and contributing to the country. Therefore, it is uncertain whether James contributes to the country.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n<PREMISES>\nNo songs are visual.\nAll folk songs are songs.\nAll videos are visual.\nAll movies are videos.\nAll sci-fi movies are movies.\nInception is a sci-fi movie.\nMac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nInception is a folk song.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Inception is a folk song. We know that Inception is a sci-fi movie. Since all movies are videos and Inception is a movie, it is a video, which means it is visual. On the other hand, we know that all folk songs are songs, and no songs are visual, so no folk songs are visual. Therefore, since Inception is visual but no folk songs are visual, we know that Inception cannot be a folk song, so the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n<PREMISES>\nEvery chef can cook.\nSome people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\nPeople who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\nIf someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\nBakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\nLuke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nLuke can make a good breakfast.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Luke can make a good breakfast. From the last premise, we know that Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins. Since Luke can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker. Now, combining the information we have, since Luke is a baker and can make scrambled eggs, this means that they can make a good breakfast. Therefore, Luke can make a good breakfast, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n<PREMISES>\nETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\nETS administers international tests including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE and subject tests in more than 180 countries.\nMany of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\nETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nETS develops assessments for K-12 statewide as well as entry to US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if ETS develops assessments for K-12 statewide as well as entry to US tertiary and quaternary educatiand doon institutions. We know that ETS develops assessments for K-12 statewide. We also know that ETS develops assessments associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutes. Therefore, both parts of the conclusion are true, and the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n<PREMISES>\nChina is one of BRICS and its economy is emerging.\nIndia is one of BRICS and its economy is emerging.\nAll people from China speak Chinese.\nAll people from India speak Hindi or English.\nThere is an Indian.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nThere is a person from BRICS speaking Hindi.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if there is a person from BRICS speaking Hindi. We know that there is an Indian, and since India is one of BRICS, we know that there is an Indian in BRICS. Furthermore, we know that they speak either Hindi or English, however, we don't know which one. Therefore, there could be a person in BRICS speaking Hindi, or there could not. Therefore, it is uncertain whether there is a person from BRICS speaking Hindi.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n<PREMISES>\nAll students are humans.\nIf someone studies, then they are a student.\nA person either studys or teaches.\nNo young person teaches.\nJerry neither teaches nor is a manager.\nRose is young or a student.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nRose is a human or Jerry is a manager.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.
