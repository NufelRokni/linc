Therefore, if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous. From premise 3, we know that if an animal jumps, then Jane likes it. So, if KiKi is terricolous, then Jane likes it. From premise 5, we know that if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. Therefore, if KiKi has legs, then Jane likes it. From premise 2, we know that if an animal barks, then Jane does not like it. So, if KiKi barks, then Jane does not like it. From premise 1, we know that all dogs are animals that bark. From premise 4, we know that if an animal has legs, then it jumps. Therefore, if KiKi has legs, then KiKi is a dog, since all dogs are animals that bark. From premise 3, we know that if an animal jumps, then Jane likes it. So, if KiKi is a dog, then Jane likes it. Therefore, from premise 1, we know that if an animal barks, then Jane does not like it, and if KiKi is a dog, then Jane likes it. So, if KiKi is a dog, then Jane does not like it.
