Error in parsing and/or evaluating LLM output: Invalid generation: Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm. From the last premise, we know that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show. Therefore, since all shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows, Breaking Bad is not a show that portrays the lives of real people. Therefore, since we know that all shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows and Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, we know that Breaking Bad is not on the Bachelor. Therefore, we know that roses given out on TV is not Breaking Bad. Therefore, Breaking Bad is not on the Bachelor, and we also know that on some Mondays at 8 pm, roses are given out on TV. Therefore, Breaking Bad is not on the Bachelor, and we also know that on some Mondays at 8 pm, roses are given out on TV. Therefore, Breaking Bad is not on the Bachelor, and we also know that on some Mondays at 8 pm, roses are given out on TV. Therefore, Breaking Bad is not on the Bachelor, and we also know that on some Mondays at 8 pm, roses are given out on TV. Therefore, Breaking Bad is not on the Bachelor, and we also know that on some Mondays at 8 pm, roses are given out on TV. Therefore, Breaking Bad is not on the Bachelor, and we also know that on some Mondays at 8 pm, roses are given out on TV. Therefore, Breaking Bad is not on the Bachelor, and we also know that on some Mondays at 8 pm, roses are given out on TV. Therefore, Breaking Bad is not on the Bachelor, and we also know that on some Mondays at 8 pm, roses are given out on TV. Therefore, Breaking Bad is not on the Bachelor, and we also know that on some Mondays at 8 pm, roses are given out on TV. Therefore, Breaking Bad is not on the Bachelor, and we also know that on some Mondays at 8 pm, roses are given out on TV.

Error in parsing and/or evaluating LLM output: Invalid generation: Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Mia's favorite season is spring. From the first premise, we know that spring is a season. From the second premise, we know that students who want to have a long vacation love summer the most. From the third premise, we know that Emma's favorite season is summer. From the fourth premise, we know that Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's. From the fifth premise, we know that James wants to have a long vacation. Since Emma is a student and James wants to have a long vacation, this means that Emma is a student who wants to have a long vacation. From the second premise, we know that students who want to have a long vacation love summer the most. Therefore, Emma loves summer the most, which means her favorite season is summer. Since Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's, Mia's favorite season is not summer. Since we know that spring is a season, it is one of the four seasons, which means it is spring, which means it is a season. Since Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's, it is not summer, which means it is one of the three other seasons. Therefore, Mia's favorite season is either spring, fall, or winter. However, from the first premise, we know that there are four seasons, and from the fifth premise, we know that James wants to have a long vacation. Since James is a student and he wants to have a long vacation, this means that James is a student who wants to have a long vacation. From the second premise, we know that students who want to have a long vacation love summer the most. Therefore, James loves summer the most, which means his favorite season is summer. Since Mia's favorite season is not the same as James', it is not summer. Therefore, Mia's favorite season is not summer, which means it is either spring, fall, or winter. Since from the first premise, we know that there are four seasons, and since from the fifth premise, we know that James wants to have a long vacation, this means that James is a student who wants to have a long vacation. From the second premise, we know that students who want to have a long vacation love summer the most. Therefore, James loves summer the most, which
Error in parsing and/or evaluating LLM output: Invalid generation: Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Coco Gauff is among the most active players in major tennis. Let's assume that Coco Gauff is a player who is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association. We know that everyone who lost to Iga Świątek is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, and all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek. Therefore, Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, and is a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. From the fifth premise, we know that either female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 or male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022, so Coco Gauff is either a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 or a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. However, we know that if Coco Gauff is a player who is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or a player who lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. Therefore, Coco Gauff is a player who is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or a player who lost to Rafael Nadal, and since we know that Coco Gauff is a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, we know that Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. Since Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, she must be a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, and since we know that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek, we know that Coco Gauff lost to Iga Świątek. Since we know that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek, we know that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association. Therefore, Coco Gauff is a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, and all female
