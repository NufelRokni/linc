<EVALUATE>
Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if a worksheet is not dispensable. From premise 6, we know that a worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly. If it is paper, then from premise 3, a worksheet is woodware, and from premise 2, a worksheet is dispensable. If it is environment-friendly, we know it is good from premise 5, but we know nothing about whether it is dispensable. Therefore, we don't know if a worksheet is dispensible or not, so the statement is uncertain.
