All humans are students.
If someone is a student, then they study.
A person either studies or teaches.
We'll also need to rewrite the conclusion. We want to know if Jerry is young, so we can rewrite the conclusion as follows:
Jerry is young.
Now, we can proceed. If we follow the premises logically, we find that Jerry is either a student or a human (premise 1).
If Jerry is a student, then he studies (premise 2).
We know that Jerry is either a student or studies (premise 3).
If Jerry doesn't study, then he is a student (premise 2).

1. All growth companies’ stocks are volatile.
Growth(x) ⊃ Volatile(x)
2. If the stock price is volatile, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
Volatile(x) ⊃ ¬Suitable_for_retirement_fund(x)
3. Some companies’ stocks are growth companies’ stocks.
Some(x) ∧ Companies_stock(x) ∧ Growth_companies_stock(x)

Mature(x) ⊃ Suitable_for_retirement_fund(x)
5. KO is a mature company’s stock.
KO ∧ Mature(KO) ∧ Companies_stock(KO)
Now we can evaluate the conclusion. Let’s assume that KO is a growth company’s stock and its price is volatile. Then we have the following:
Growth(KO) ∧ Volatile(KO)
∴ Volatile(KO) ∧ ¬Suitable_for_retirement_fund(KO)
By the transitivity of implication, we have:
KO ∧ ¬Suitable_for_retirement_fund(KO)

Now we assume that KO is a growth company’s stock but its price is not volatile. Then we have the following:
Growth(KO) ∧ Volatile(KO)
∴ Volatile(KO) ∧ ¬Suitable_for_retirement_fund(KO)
By the transitivity of implication, we have:

From premise 7, we know that if John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July or, if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon. So, if we can determine if John has a wedding in July, then we can figure out if John has a wedding that is well-attended.

Looking at premise 2, we know that all people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon are people who have a wedding. From this, we can conclude that if John does not travel to Paris for their honeymoon, then John does not have a wedding. This statement is false, since it is true that John travels to Paris for their honeymoon.

We know from premise 1 that all people who have a wedding are people who have at least one child, so if John does not have at least one child, then John does not have a wedding. This statement is true, since it is true that John does not have at least one child.

Since premise 6 is false, we can conclude that John does not travel to Paris for their honeymoon and does not have a wedding.

From premise 3, we know that all people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon are people who have a wedding. If we can determine if John travels to Paris for their honeymoon, then we can determine if John has a wedding. Looking at premise 5, we know that if John has at least one child, then John does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding. Since we already know that John does not have at least one child, we can conclude that John does not travel to Paris for their honeymoon and does not have a wedding.

Now we can evaluate if John has a wedding in July. From premise 4, we know that some weddings in July are well-attended. Looking at premise 3, we know that all people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon are people who have a wedding. Since we already know that John does not travel to Paris for their honeymoon and does not have a wedding, we can conclude that John does not have a wedding in July.

Error in parsing and/or evaluating LLM output: Invalid generation: Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings. From premise 6, we know that Luke is either both a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members, or he neither is a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members. From premise 2, we know that if Luke has siblings who are the same age, then he is twins or triplets. From premise 3, we know that if Luke complains often about annoying siblings, then he has siblings who are the same age. From premise 4, we know that if Luke does not live at home regularly, then he does not develop strong bonds with his family members. From premise 5, we know that if Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, then he often did not live at home regularly.

Since we know that Luke is either both a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members, or he neither is a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members, we can evaluate each case.

In the case where Luke is both a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members, from premise 2, we know that he has siblings who are the same age, and from premise 3, we know that he complains often about annoying siblings. From premise 5, we know that if he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, then he often did not live at home regularly. Since Luke complains often about annoying siblings, we know he has siblings who are the same age, and therefore, since he often did not live at home regularly, we know that he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.

In the case where Luke is neither a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members, from premise 4, we know that he does not live at home regularly, and from premise 5, we know that if he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, then he often did not live at home regularly. Since Luke does not live at home regularly, we know that he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.
