Since from premise 6, we know that KiKi either jumps or has legs, we can conclude that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous, and from premise 5, we know that if KiKi is terricolous, then it has legs. Therefore, we conclude that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous and has legs. From premise 4, we know that if an animal has legs, then it jumps. Therefore, if KiKi has legs, then KiKi jumps. Since we know that KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi neither barks nor is a dog.
