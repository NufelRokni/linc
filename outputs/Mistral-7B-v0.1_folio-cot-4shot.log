Error in parsing and/or evaluating LLM output: Invalid generation: Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Coco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal. First, we know that if Coco Gauff is a player who is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or a player who lost to Rafael Nadal, then she is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. This is because, according to premise 6, everyone who lost to Rafael Nadal is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, and premise 5 states that everyone who is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association is among the most active players in major tennis. So, if Coco Gauff is a player who is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then she is a player who is among the most active players in major tennis, and therefore she is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. Similarly, if Coco Gauff is a player who lost to Rafael Nadal, then she is a player who is among the most active players in major tennis, and therefore she is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
So, we know that if Coco Gauff is a player who is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or a player who lost to Rafael Nadal, then she is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. Next, we know that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek, and that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal. Combining these two pieces of information, we can conclude that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal.
Finally, we know that all players who lost to Rafael Nadal are among the most active players in major tennis, and that all players who lost to Rafael Nadal are ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association. Combining these two pieces of information, we can conclude that all players who lost to Rafael Nadal are among the most active players in major tennis.

From the first premise, we know that if people are twins or triplets, then they spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings. Let's assume that Luke is either both a twin or triplet or that Luke doesn't develop strong bonds with his family members. We need to check if either of these assumptions contradicts any of the other premises. Let's check the first assumption. From the first premise, we know that if people are twins or triplets, then they spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings. From the third premise, we know that if people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who are the same age. From the fourth premise, we know that if people have siblings who are the same age, then they are twins or triplets. From the fifth premise, we know that if people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often did not live at home regularly. From the sixth premise, we know that if people do not live at home regularly, then they do not develop strong bonds with their family members. From the last premise, we know that Luke is either both a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members, or he neither is a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members. From the seventh premise, we know that if Luke is both a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members, then he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings. From the eighth premise, we know that if Luke neither is a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members, then he does not spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings. Therefore, from the seventh and eighth premises, if Luke is either both a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members, then he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, or if Luke neither is a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members, then he does not spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.
